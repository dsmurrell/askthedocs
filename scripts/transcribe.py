    "first": "Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi, guys. How are you doing? Where are you? We're doing well. You seem to be in a box. This is not a box, actually. This is a, I'm actually in the Google London office. We're there for a meeting. They're all trying to get us to use GCP, so I'm here pitching up for a bit longer. So yeah, that's why I'm here. That's where I am, a different box in a different office. Yeah, I was expecting better from Google. It's actually not a box. It's a pod, but it's not soundproof. So yeah, it's not exactly private. But anyway, I'll keep my voice down when talking about GCP. Yeah, it's a semi-upgrade. I'm not quite sure if class is an upgrade. Harry Potter's room. There's actually a Harry Potter theme in all of the rooms. Is that why you say this, Lauren? It just looks like it's under a stairwell. I see. Because a lot of the floors have like, one was like, separate, like some of the rooms have like, it's like a Harry Potter theme. It's like a Dumbledore landing and stuff like that. So I thought, I didn't realize Google had a sort of story about Harry Potter, but I think maybe it doesn't, maybe it's just unrelated. I didn't know that either. Good to know. Yeah, it's interesting. And so to confirm, you know, that massive office that is, you go into King's Cross and you see the massive building work to the right-hand side, that is the new Google office, apparently, which is everyone was sort of thinking about, but yeah, it's unreal. Let's see if it still is once they lose their search business, we'll see. We'll know when it switches to the Microsoft offices. Yes. Well, if ever like that building gets canceled, you know, something's happened. Yeah. It literally has. It's just like a carrot. It's like, don't leave. The office is coming. It's coming, oh, next year, next year. Just a retainer, golden handcuffs. Don't they already have an office in King's Cross? Or are they moving? They do. I'm in that one right now, but they're moving like five minutes walk away. Oh, okay, cool. And yes, Jonathan, I'm inside the office right now. Talking mildly. How's everyone doing this Thursday? Good. Doing very well. Congratulations, Rochelle. Oh, thank you. I haven't had it since the news was on public channel. Yeah. Very exciting. Thanks, thanks. Exciting times, can't be selfish anymore. Thanks. Gotta be responsible now. Right, I know. I had to cancel my trip this summer, which was absolutely devastating. But hey, you know, life. How's everyone else? Good, thumbs up. Nice. Doing very well. Some interaction and engagement. You didn't get much opportunity for a thumb down. Rochelle. Yeah, I'll interact with you, Rochelle. I'll just keep chattering on. Oh, so we're 10 minutes in so we can get started. Cause I believe the PM team have quite a lot to share this week. We do have a new All Hands schedule that's potentially gonna be launching somewhat very soon. So please keep a lookout for that. I'll let you all know what is on the agenda. But we're gonna go through our normal scheduling today. So I'll let Axel kick off with a sequencing update. Yeah, thanks. Hopefully for one time I will be able to share. Should work. Yeah. It's working. This thing is annoying me. Can you see my screen? Yes, we can. Yeah. Okay, cool. So it will be a short update on like everything we are doing because there is a lot of things ongoing, but I will try to do a more focus on like the report that a lot of us work on last week. So update for the sequencing team that is part of our like three goals. So the first one is internalization. Please find me another word for that. I will never be able to pronounce that in English ever. For network lab, the gene by gene pilot. So gene by gene will be one of our new provider in US. The pilot is in phase three, meaning that all of the samples are back in the lab and some of the data already back with us. So now it's like seeing the quality of their data. So the integration and the communication with them and the logistics seems to work well. So now we are looking at the data. When that would be done, we will compare also, we are comparing GSA data. We will compare WES data. And when it's done, we can start with them. Gene by gene also, we are doing a lot of things with them because first they are super responding. They are accommodating. They are having amazing prices. So we are doing also a validation of new techniques like first the PCR for repeat expansion for two study and also the APO-L1 test. We are also trying to do it with urofine in Europe, but they are not like as good as gene by gene for answering things, but it will work and we'll do it. But gene by gene is already on the case and should be in validation by first week of July in US. We are also looking for a partner for the APO-L1 test because the problem is the New York state. So gene by gene can have a validated test for us working in every states because they have all of the license and everything, but the New York state is a problem. So after talking with Lindsay, it's something that we don't want to lose. So I'm trying to reach to different provider like Mayo Clinic and things like that to try to see if they can work with us. What would be the price if they can do integration with us to be able to offer APO-L1 validated test as LDT in New York state. So that is part of what we are doing right now. In terms of logistic partner, the good news is SIREN is in use for the gold study. Apparently the samples are going back and forth, the API integration is working. I cannot see any bug right now. So that is a good news. We will still look for different partner to make sure that the goal for us is to make sure that we have at least two labs and two logistic partner in every country or in every, you know, if they can do Europe that we have at least two. But that's mean we don't use Eurofine anymore in Denmark to send sample in UK and receive them. So that is a gain of money and time. In term of the genetic counselor, we are talking with new possible genetic counselor for EU and UK, but that is more on the genetic counselor point. But it's really interesting same thing to try to have multiple provider. So that could help us. In term of kits, we are working in the background to find a new provider for the kits in US. Again, it will probably go to gene by gene because as I was saying, I don't know what they cannot do for the moment. Lee is working with them for a new design. Their price is really competitive. Right now, Eurofine is asking us $15 per kit, everything included. And apparently gene by gene, it goes down to like $4. So it will be fast. They also, we are going to change the return solution. So for people who knows a kit right now, you return the box and we are changing that for an envelope, which is a secure one. It's a classified one, but meaning that we can enter in every little box. We will less have a problem. We just had a kid this week return open because the box break. So normally with the envelope should not happen. Hopefully I'm crossing my finger on this one. That is for internationalization. Internationalization, I promise you. For the genetic report. So I was saying I would go deep dive on it, but just to let you know, we are now working with an external provider, which is Fabric. We signed the contract, ETH, Adam and everybody's working on the implementation for Fabric and Sano together. So it's like a lot of different steps. And it's, I think way more complicated than what we anticipate, but it will work. Fabric for the moment will work for us for external report on the wares. So the GSA report will still be in-house. So what we did is like we are creating a report template for wares that Fabric will be able to use, but also what is useful is now, this report template can be used also for GSA internally. And that means all of our reports will have the same type of like design and language. So that is also really useful, but I will go better on that. For genetic counseling, Great Genetic is now on the approved list after Sa did the QA questionnaire with it. She will work with us for Lights Away for US and UK. She's right now reviewing the report template for the wares. And also I'm looking at the report template and I'm looking and I find, and I'm discuss with like a potential European network for genetic counselor. So I'm talking with one of the lead right now to see if that could be helpful for us and what will be the price and the timeline. Also talking about counseling for all of the PM or anybody who need like document with Eleanor Gray, what we put in place with her is I created a document with her that if you need her to work on a project or one of the genetic counselor for like any study, you have access to like a questionnaire that you need to fill in. So she will know which of the counselor will be the one that could be the most fitted. If you need somebody speaking Spanish or if you need a specialist for ALS or something else. And so also it will help her to like plan in advance number of patient that we are thinking of and what type of counseling we are thinking because she need to fit us in our schedule. It makes sense. If you have any question, I cannot read the chat in the same time. So just yell at me and I will answer. No question? Okay. So now I can see the chat. It's great. The deep dive. Yes, I'm sorry. But every time somebody is talking about deep dive, I'm just like thinking at the movie, Le Grand Bleu, which is a big blue. And I don't know if you ever watch it, but for people who never watch this movie, it's pretty amazing. It's a pretty old movie and it's based on the real story of Jack Meyer who was like a free diver. And we did like break the record of like, I think 140 meters down on free dive. And I really, really liked this movie, but it's more also, and it will link, I promise you to like genetic report. But what we did for the genetic report, working with everybody is try to see every point of view on like how the patients as provider, how genetic counselor, how Sano will read this report. And if you watch Le Grand Bleu at one point, one of the guys say between what I think, what I want to say, what I believe I'm saying, what I say, what I want you to hear, what you hear, what you understand, there is at least nine possibility of misunderstanding. And it's exactly what we are trying to tackle in this report, trying to think about how the patient will read the report, what they're expecting from us, what the HCP will expect, how they will read it, how the genetic counselor will read it, how it's good for us to build it in terms of regulation and quality. So I will show you all of the report, but right now this is the design, by the way, all of that is amazing work of Mercedes, Marissa and Lee, who work a lot with after the feedback and the background. And Marissa did like an amazing job at integrating all of our feedback and working back and forth on it. So that is an example of like a positive test. So how it was designed is the first page. Here, it's really the first things, it's patient-orientated, it's what the patient wants to know when you open your report, you want to know what is your result. Then the rest is something when you have more time that you will read. So it was really important to have this first page where the patient can see and can understand. I will explain, but there is a code on reading. Then the two other page are more in-depth explanation. Like, you know, you go in like variant and position in the genome and what is a ZgoZT and the classification and recommendation, but you also have all of the clinical information and the clinical reference. So the second part is almost for people who already have a knowledge of like, you know, sequencing or people who are like really interesting to understand their results, but also for health provider and for genetic counselor to be able to read with a patient with all of the clinical information that could be useful. There is like few details that were thought through this all reports as, for example, you always have the sample ID and the patient name on the top. So you don't mix the page. Trust me, it already happened and I saw that. And when people mix the first page and the other one, you don't end up with the same result and people panicking. So we put that. There is also details on every page that when you look at your results, you have on the first page, even if you don't have the other page, you have your result and you have a brief explanation of what is it. You have the reason for the test, you have your result and you have a small interpretation of your results. If it's positive, negative or variant of uncertainty. And I think that will be the main focus on the patient before they go to the other side. What I really like what the whole team did is having a reading code, meaning that every time you have wording on any sort which is not in common knowledge, you have a reading code associated. So with your results, you have the reading code. When you go more in depth in your details, you also have a reading code of like a gene, a variant position. So people will be able to like understand what all of that means, at least have a first understanding, even classification. Something also that was done is having four points of caution. So the one thing is like explaining first that this result is limited by the technology and is limited and valid on the days that you are. Meaning that the ways, if like the technology change or the depth change, there is a possibility we find different variants of things like that. Then the second point of caution was also the result is not a diagnostic and shouldn't be used to manage any condition. And I think that is really important that we repeat it again and again for the patient and everybody. The third point of caution is like, we look at some of the genes as 2D classification. Again, we repeat a little bit, but just to say that it's only as 2D knowledge. If we were looking again at the reading, like in a year, we'd probably see different things. It's a possibility because classification change. And the last one is really saying that this is only a research only test. This is not a diagnostic. It cannot be used for a clinical diagnostic. And in all of that, we always put, please, if you want going further, you need like further testing and going to like see a genetic counselor to talk about your results. So I think it will help a lot the patients and us in terms of regulation. Something was also really important to put on the test and that we had a discussion about is testing methodology. And why we put that, it's because if you want, if the patient one day go to another lab or go with their report, they will be able to like see the methodologies that we use to produce our reports, meaning that you can compare data to other things or not. And it's something, for example, we are looking at if we are receiving report from other company, the methodology is really important to make sure that we can compare data, we can use the data. Also something that I think is great. So when you see at the report, there is some part will stay the same for every report. There is part will be study specific and there is part will like patient specific. So what Marisa did is having like a color coded things. So for the engineering team, it will help knowing what will always stay in the templates, except if we really want to change it. For example, definition will be universal. It's, you know, positive, negative, variance, uncertainty should be the same. What is patient specific will be why you are enrolled in the study, your data, your results, that will be. And study specific will be really like which gene we are looking at, the license number on the lab, because depending if you are working in UK or US, that will change. So that was like the positive one. If you just look at the negative, because so you have a report, we did a template per type of results. So the negative one looks really similar. The only thing is you are losing the table here. And we change the recommendation. So you cannot see it, but the recommendation say like, there is no variant of interest associated with this study that was identified as pathogenic, but we still can support you to discuss result if you need it. So that is for like the way that it was really specifically designed, but it's kind of the things. And still it's not because it's negative that you don't have all of the information needed to understand your results. And that is really a little bit more specific is like the variant of uncertain significance or unknown significance. It depends what you look at. And it look a lot like the positive one, except the recommendation is a little bit different because it's not part of like being positive or negative. It's like, it's a possibility that it's associated as with a disease, but you really need to talk with like a genetic counselor or health professional to talk about that. That's all for me. If you have any question, I will be sharing that. Any question? Or it's clear, or also if you want to look at it and have any comment or change things, please let us know. It's really useful to have like a lot of people looking at it and put yourself into like patient's side and say like, if I receive that, I won't be happy with that or I would be happy with that or I'm missing that. No? It looks good. Clear as mud as Liam would say. But really if somebody like want to look at them and give us like feedback, please do it. That's all for me. We can go to the end, right? Diane, sex out. I think I'm first. So Julie, do you mind? I can drive first if you like. Yep, we're good. Right, so we've got a lot of different study updates today. So I'll be quick on the ones that can be quick. So I've been able to study. Basically on our end, we're all ready to go. All of the study materials are developed. Our partner, who's going to actually be doing all of the sample collection, Richmond Pharmacology is ready to go. We're just waiting on AstraZeneca to sign the change order that's been with them for a couple of weeks now. Essentially what the barrier has been is that AstraZeneca is having to go through all of their contracts they have out right now and add a clause about data privacy that they didn't have before. And the change order triggered that change in the contract. So they're just working through that contracting issue, but they don't think it's going to be a problem for the study actually moving forward. It's just a longer process than we'd anticipated. So everything's ready to go and be submitted once we've got the final signatures from them. I'm still estimating that the launch date is going to be late June or early July, because I think that we should have an answer from them either this week or early next week. So the hope is that we still can get this submitted within the next week or two, and it won't delay our launch too far, but I'll keep everybody updated when they finally sign the change order. So any questions on bold before I move on to light the way? Nice. Okay, so I've got some really exciting updates from like the way you already saw from Oxel, some of the reports that everybody's been working on and are really nice. It gives everybody who's coming at this from a different results, a really nice and clean and same experience. So I think that that's like such a great thing that everybody's put together there. So on light the way for those who may not be familiar, just give a brief overview. Essentially light the way is a platform that we're developing through an innovate UK grants that's aiming to create a multinational and multilingual program to offer genetic testing and genetic counseling to people who are at risk of ALS. And we're gonna be launching first in the UK and then in the US, and we're gonna be launching in English and in Spanish. And I'm just gonna zoom bar keeps stuck at the bottom there. So we are in a really good place with light the way. We've got all of the patient facing materials completes our protocol and informed consent form and our statistical analysis plan are all ready to go. Right now, we're just about to send off this packet of all the patient facing materials to our PPI group and the patient advocacy work that's working with us and they're called in the legacy. Just gonna give a brief shout out to Grace. She's gonna be the face of the PPI work going forward for any of the other studies if people who are working on them wants a PPI review. And what I wanna spend a little bit more time in a couple of slides.",
    "second": "about is some of this educational material that we've developed. This is, I think, new for Sano and some of the studies that we're running, but particularly for this study, education is really important because having a positive diagnosis for ALS can impact a lot of things in people's lives. It's a really serious diagnosis to get and it can impact certain things like, you know, your family, your ability to get different types of insurance, like life insurance and types of medical insurances. So it's really important that people understand what this process is going to look like for them and what potential impacts it may have. So with all that in mind, we worked really hard with a genetic counselor who's a specialist in ALS to develop this educational program that people go through before they decide that they want to continue with genetic testing. So I'll give you a little sneak peek of what that looks like in a second. So before I do that, I'll just run over some high-level timelines with everybody so everyone's on the same track. Our protocol and patient-based materials, as I've mentioned, are all ready to go. We're just doing a final review with our PPI groups. Product is thinking that they'll be able to get everything pulled together by the 27th of June, which works really well. Depending on how long the ethics approval takes, we're going to be submitting the UK first. We should be ready to launch in the UK between the 20th, but at the latest we'll be launching on the 11th of July because that is when we have the INCALS conference, which we'll be having a poster at. And these are just the timelines for the US, which will be delayed by a couple of weeks after we submit the UK ethics submission because they need to be translated into Spanish, additionally. So on to the good stuff. So this is a description of what the education program is going to look like. Essentially, it's going to have, in the second version, going to have an option to be video or a blog, just depending how people best learn. Some people want to see someone speaking to them, some people want to take some time to digest this information on their own, so they'll have the option to watch either or do both. After each one of these sections, we're also going to introduce a check your understanding, a type of review, to make sure people are comprehending a lot of information we're putting to them. And these aren't like definitions or anything like that, but they're questions that are really important to making sure they're understanding, like, the life insurance impacts and things that we want to make sure people are aware of. So it's just a couple of questions after each section, but I think it'll be a really nice addition, and then all those questions and answers will be available for people to review at any time. And this is a sketch of what we think that that's going to look like. This is something that Marissa has put together. She's been an absolute star working through how users are actually going to work with this education content that is completely new for us. So as you can see at the top, it'll have the video option, and at the bottom, it'll be the blog. And I've got some info here about what that'll look like. So on the right here, this is a visual of what the blog could look like, and Mercedes worked on all of these images, and they're great. For the videos, I think it's really, really cool. I'm excited about that. So I'm not gonna have you watch the whole thing, but we'll just watch a little bit of the intro and show you what we've put together and what it's gonna look like for the participants when they're going through it. I hope you'll be able to hear the sound. Hi there, I'm Lainey, and I'm a genetic counselor for the University of Pennsylvania's ILS Center and FTD Center. In this video series, I'll be talking you through the genetics of ILS, also called motor neuron disease, and addressing the questions that I get asked the most as a genetic counselor. Specifically, I'm going to walk you through the genetics of ILS, genetic testing, and whether it's right for you, and what you can expect if you go down the genetic testing route. So these are available for anybody to see. I'll show you one more animation just because I think it's really cool. But basically, if you guys have feedback on these, we'd love to see what you think. We are working hard to learn about what those factors actually are, such as environmental exposures, trauma to the body, lifestyle factors, and small genetic risk factors. There's also research underway to better understand what might protect someone from developing ILS. Right, so that's a sneak peek of the educational content, but if anyone is more interested in it, like what the actual videos look like, or any, just want to have a look at it all put together, Mercedes and I can show you the links. But yeah, so I want to say thank you to Mercedes, thank you to Marissa. They've been getting huge shoutouts during this All Hands, and they absolutely deserve it because they've done huge work to putting this together, and I couldn't be more pleased. And also Amy for actually writing all the blog content. They've all been great. And any questions about Light the Way for me, we'll hand over to Decibel. Any chance we could break down the videos into chapters, find it useful for our videos to skip the parts I'm interested in? Yeah, I think that's a great idea to put in like, what are they called? Bookmarks? They're not bookmarks, but the benches with the information, that would be a good addition to it. Right. Jamie, you're on Decibel? Yeah, I'm on Decibel today as Liam is bubbling on his way back home, I think. So are you holding now? Are you controlling it? Cool. Yeah, hold on the forward. Perfect. So this is Decibel. And I guess a quick recap for those that don't know, it's an awareness and engagement campaign for patients and caregivers of those with hearing loss and genetic hearing loss. And I guess a quick summary of this study is that it will be broken down into two phases. The first phase will be a landing page. And this is being aimed to be developed by the 26th of May. The second phase will be a go live on the full portal. And this is aiming to be ready by the 21st of July. However, this makes, if we're basically unsure if there's a IRB need for this study, because of its uniqueness, and because it's not technically qualified as research, we're kind of in discussion with Decibel at the moment as to whether this needs full IRB approval and will kind of impact the timelines as necessary. But yeah, we're currently assessing if we can move forward with the project without an IRB approval. And we hopefully expect to hear back from them towards the end of next week. So that should give us some sort of clarification on that. While we wait for that, we're kind of proactively developing a protocol anyway, in case we do need to go down the IRB route, and that's kind of being ready, hopefully ready by Tuesday next week. And so Hayley, if you can just move to the next slide, please. Cool. So as you can see, the timelines are pretty much as they were before. And we are on track with the only contentious issue is if we need IRB approval, which might push back the protocol development timelines, and then ultimately the go live timeline by a few weeks. However, if not, then it should be back to a standard time yielded ready by the 21st of July. Does anyone have any questions on Decibel? I guess we can move on. I think Julie on it. Hi, everyone. So this is just a quick overview of where we are on the Lilly study. So for those of you who don't know, this study is involving patients with frontotemporal dementia, which is a form of dementia similar to Alzheimer's disease. And we're working with Prevail, who is a subsidiary of Lilly on this project. So the summary, the external kickoff meeting was held on the 3rd of April. And the protocol is currently in development, in addition to the patient information sheet and the informed consent form. And the only thing with the informed consent form and the PIS at the minute is we just need to agree on the wording in relation to pre-test genetic counselling and what that involves, and also if there's any additional cost, I guess, related to what we actually decide on for the study. And the informed consent options involving a study partner or caregiver, which is kind of common in these type of diseases, has been drafted with HANA, and those have been sent off to Lilly. And we're just awaiting feedback on those. And that impacts the wording in the ICF as well. And in terms of the genetic reporting, this will be unchanged at the minute from our current process, i.e. the report will only be sent to the participant at the minute, and not also the study partner or their caregiver. And just a note as well, in addition to mutations in the GRN gene, we're also testing for mutations in the MIPT and the C9ORF, and we need to repeat. And the study questionnaire is also in development as well, in addition to the patient profile. And Helen and Lindsay are trying to get a meeting with James Howley from Prevail in terms of pushing that forward. So, the aims for all the above documentation to be sent to Prevail for review by next Friday, 5th of May. Next one, please, Lilly. Thank you. So, this is just an overview of the initial timelines that we have for the USA launch. So, as I said, all the materials sent to Prevail for review on 5th of May have those reviewed and comments incorporated by the 2nd of June, with the aim for IRB submission on the 30th of June, and the study launch on the 17th of July. And we're also translating it to Spanish for the US as well, so that IRB submission will be 30th, 31st of July, with the study launched in the US in Spanish on the 14th of August. So, any questions on the Lilly update? Okay, so this is just an overview of where we are with the UC study. So, we have managed to send the final datasets to BII, it's Benevolent AI and C4xD, who we're also collaborating with on this project, and they were sent off on the 13th of April, and I'll go through that in detail on the next slide. So, we managed to get medical records retrieved for 399 patients out of the 619 that were actually enrolled in the study. And out of those 399 patients, we identified 251, where the ulcerative colitis diagnosis was confirmed from the medical record. And the target initially from the protocol was to identify 500 patients, 250 with mild or moderate UC and 250 with severe UC. So, I guess I've coloured it in amber for overall performance, just based on that alone, otherwise everything went well for the study. So, at the minute, we're awaiting confirmation of any additional testing that may be required for these patients. So, BII had mentioned the possibility of OAS analysis, and that's also been included in the protocol, in addition to a blood sample that was also possibly to be collected for transcriptomic analysis, although that may not materialise. I know there was some questions recently on the biobanking of these samples and whether we should destroy them or not. So, I think at the minute, until we have the confirmation, I guess, from BII, that will be no further analysis needed, and we should just continue to keep those samples. The other thing that we've been working on is a blog post in collaboration with BII as well. So, that is more or less ready to be published any time. There's just one small update to be made to specify that it was a UK government in the first section. Otherwise, we have the OK to publish that any time. And, yeah, BII will be publishing their post, I think, next Tuesday. There's no requirement to publish it at the same time. So, I guess, Amy, if you're on the call, you can go ahead and do that. So, very big thank you to you, and also to Heath for getting that ready and working with BII to get that done. Okay, next slide. Thank you. So, this is just a summary of the study stats and the study delivery that we've managed to get for this study. So, 619 patient medical records requested. Out of those, we retrieved 399, and out of those 399, 251 patients with UC were confirmed. And we have sent genetic data for 405 patients to BII and C4X, and also for the genetic data and medical record information, where the UC diagnosis was confirmed for 183 patients, and then a subset of 89 patients where we have the genetic data and the medical record, but they have no UC confirmed, and otherwise an alternative diagnosis of something like Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease. That has also been sent off to them as well. I think that's up for UC. So, yeah, we're just waiting, basically, on the confirmation, if any, another analysis needs to be done. Otherwise, we can fill out the study closure form and then send that off to the IRB. But we wait. We wait for BII's update and C4X's update to see if we can do that or not. Okay. So, lastly, then, an update on where we are with Virtex. So, there has been a lot of kind of back and forward recently with the Virtex regulatory and legal teams who became involved in the review of the study protocol and documentation, including the ICF, the information sheet, and the awareness materials when they were initially sent in October last year. So, the Virtex teams have expressed a number of small concerns with our current process. So, that initiated many email exchanges and many meetings with those teams. So, culminating in us providing a revised SANA proposal last week. Also, the reason for the above kind of AMBER statuses and performance satisfaction and delivery on target. So, at the minute, the Virtex teams are currently reviewing that proposal, and we're just awaiting the setup of a final meeting to discuss with Virtex for them to hopefully provide the green light to proceed, maybe, with the new plan. And this would be a Virtex-only proposal at this point. So, yeah, we just recently got an email there. ThreePatrick, I don't know if you've seen it. I sent off a request to Sarah. They've actually asked for a due diligence form to be filled out again, and also a list of our SOPs and a copy of the recent contract and a more in-depth sort of scope of work, which we'll get to work on. But, yeah, kind of odd requests, I guess, at this point in the study. But, yeah, if we can get the due diligence form filled out and a list of SOPs, and then we can work on the other questions that they sent through. But, yeah, so there's been quite a lot of discussions with Virtex, really. And potentially, it may impact other projects, which we may set up with them, but we just need to get their agreement, really, on what way they want to proceed with the study. So, hopefully, we can have that within the next couple of weeks with them. So, we have actually updated the study awareness and recruitment materials based on the last meeting we had, a big meeting with the clinical team, and those materials were actually ready for PAG review, but that has actually just been placed on hold pending the outcome of the meeting on how we're going to move forward with Virtex. So, yeah, a bit of a holding game at the minute still. So, yeah, that's where we are with Virtex. Any questions on that one? Just a quick question from my side, Julie. Is it kind of expected to have, like, these sort of issues come up with the legal team towards the end, like when we've already got all of the content for the study and we're about to launch? Or is it normal, not normal? Yeah, Hans, I don't know. Well, from the very start of the study, I guess it was a different kind of group called this FASTER group, I think, from Virtex. Maybe, Patrick, you can talk to us a bit more, but I don't think that the legal and the regulatory teams were involved at the very start, or maybe were kind of silly aware of what exactly we were doing, and they were brought in maybe after October, whenever we sent all these materials across and started to get involved in the process and started to ask questions. So maybe if they had been brought in at the start, it might not have got to this point, and we may have got through things quicker, but I think it's maybe just part and parcel, maybe, of the way things are set up at Virtex, and with that additional, maybe, FASTER group getting involved. But it's a potential that the bigger pharma companies may ask similar types of questions that Virtex have. So if we go with this proposal and we can actually do it, then we can possibly offer it out to other big pharma that do request a similar kind of way of doing things. Is it like a learning point to start going through the legal stuff first? Is that possible? Yeah, I mean, they can certainly deep dive into the regulations and getting things set up as, like, potentially an LDT, as Axel referred to earlier on with the likes of Gene by Gene, and then finding also a lab that can process samples from New York as well and try and kind of get that process ironed out so that we could potentially, I guess, pick and choose, depending on what kind of way the client, whoever they are, might want us to go. Based, I guess, on their knowledge, probably, as well, and the different types of expertise they have within their team. Some of the Virtex team, the regulatory team, are ex-FDA, so they do kind of ask those kind of questions, and quite a few of the legal team are involved as well, so they have definitely done their homework. But yeah, it's definitely a learning curve and, yeah, something definitely to take into account moving forward. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. So I'm just going to give a really high-level overview of the Summit and ReCode studies. So Summit is a study where the client is Summit Clinical Research. This is in non-alcoholic staudated hepatitis. So Summit is an integrated research organization, so they basically bring together research sites in NASH space. NASH is an advanced form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. There are multiple genes involved, and we are looking at 12 variants in 10 genes. Some of these variants increase the risk of NASH, and others are protective. So the Sano deliverables for this study are a Summit-branded portal used for screening, registering patients, and facilitating informed consent and genetic testing, development of protocol and IRB submission, development of supporting materials for patient recruitment, site training, genetic counseling, and a virtual waiting room for retention of patients. We will also be providing test results and patient status metrics to research sites, and the ultimate aim is to find patients who will be eligible for future clinical trials at 30 research sites and retain them. Next slide, please. Thanks. So these are our timelines. So the kickoff for the study was back in December. We started working on protocol development in early February, but the protocol has still been with the client. They're doing quite a few revisions to it, so we had to push the timelines back a little bit. We were going to really hope to submit to IRB early May, but now it's really going to be probably closer to the 25th of May. So the launch that we're looking at right now is early July. Next slide. Yeah, so I've separated this into successes, challenges, and next steps. So successes, we had a really good meeting with Summit and a few key sites yesterday with really great feedback from the client afterwards. We gained a lot of good insights on the sites that will help us develop patient recruitment and training materials for sites, and also to build a product. Summit is also interested in possibly pursuing a further project with us, but for yesterday's call, a big thank you to everybody who was involved on it from Sano. Some of the challenges we've had is that they've taken some time with the protocol revision, which has pushed back timelines, and also the time to arrange this call that we had yesterday took longer than we hoped for, but it was really worth it because it was a really useful call. So the next steps would be to finalize Genetics Test Report template and recruitment materials, outline the process for report feedback to the sites, and also discuss how to optimize the virtual waiting room for the study and start preparing the IRB submission pack so we can share it with the client for review. So everything here is in green. I've put delivery on target in orange or in amber just because we had to push the timelines a little bit. Next slide. Yeah, so for recode, next, thanks. So this is a study with Recode Therapeutics and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. So Recode Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing an mRNA therapy for PCD patients with mutations in DNA I1 gene. PCD is usually an autosomal recessive disorder, which is caused by defects in a structure and function of cilia. I have a picture of lungs there, but it affects all areas of the body where there's cilia. However, lungs are usually the most affected. We're going to be doing whole exome sequencing on 42 genes, mutations in which can lead to PCD. So SANA deliverables are patient outreach and awareness campaigns, protocol, PSICF creation, IRB submission, development of a virtual questionnaire for patient screening by healthcare providers. And also there's going to be another questionnaire where patients can self refer. Portal build for virtual consenting and ordering and genetic testing, feedback of results to patients and their healthcare providers, and genetic counseling, virtual waiting room setup, and analysis and reporting of recruitment channel success. Next slide. Yeah, so these are the timelines. Our kickoff was in mid-February. We also started developing the protocol in February. There's been a couple of revisions going back and forth. And with this one, we also had to push the timelines a little bit because the review by the client will take some time for the recruitment materials. So we just wanted to allow enough time for that. So we're looking to launch in end of June, very early July, hopefully end of June. Yeah, so for this one, the successes were that the client required a very complicated questionnaire for enrichment of PCD patient population for the study to be completed by healthcare providers. And we created this, which took a long time. It was really complicated, but they were finally happy with it. Challenges, managing the client relationship and bringing the main patient advocacy group on board. There's also been some delays caused by the complexity of the questionnaire, as I mentioned. And the next steps will be to provide a client the materials for our submission for review so that you have plenty of time to review them because there's a wide team that needs to look at those materials. So yeah, I put overall performance and delivery and Amber because we did have some challenges that caused the timelines to be pushed back. But apart from that, quality is still high and client is satisfied. Are there any questions on Summit or Eco? No? Right, perfect. That's all for me. Hello. Now that I've joined the PM team who've been wonderfully warm and welcoming, I thought I'd give an update on one of the things that I'm doing at the moment as well. So I'm here to talk about everyone's favorite topic, right?",
    "second_part_1": "about is some of this educational material that we've developed. This is, I think, new for Sano and some of the studies that we're running, but particularly for this study, education is really important because having a positive diagnosis for ALS can impact a lot of things in people's lives. It's a really serious diagnosis to get and it can impact certain things like, you know, your family, your ability to get different types of insurance, like life insurance and types of medical insurances. So it's really important that people understand what this process is going to look like for them and what potential impacts it may have. So with all that in mind, we worked really hard with a genetic counselor who's a specialist in ALS to develop this educational program that people go through before they decide that they want to continue with genetic testing. So I'll give you a little sneak peek of what that looks like in a second. So before I do that, I'll just run over some high-level timelines with everybody so everyone's on the same track. Our protocol and patient-based materials, as I've mentioned, are all ready to go. We're just doing a final review with our PPI groups. Product is thinking that they'll be able to get everything pulled together by the 27th of June, which works really well. Depending on how long the ethics approval takes, we're going to be submitting the UK first. We should be ready to launch in the UK between the 20th, but at the latest we'll be launching on the 11th of July because that is when we have the INCALS conference, which we'll be having a poster at. And these are just the timelines for the US, which will be delayed by a couple of weeks after we submit the UK ethics submission because they need to be translated into Spanish, additionally. So on to the good stuff. So this is a description of what the education program is going to look like. Essentially, it's going to have, in the second version, going to have an option to be video or a blog, just depending how people best learn. Some people want to see someone speaking to them, some people want to take some time to digest this information on their own, so they'll have the option to watch either or do both. After each one of these sections, we're also going to introduce a check your understanding, a type of review, to make sure people are comprehending a lot of information we're putting to them. And these aren't like definitions or anything like that, but they're questions that are really important to making sure they're understanding, like, the life insurance impacts and things that we want to make sure people are aware of. So it's just a couple of questions after each section, but I think it'll be a really nice addition, and then all those questions and answers will be available for people to review at any time. And this is a sketch of what we think that that's going to look like. This is something that Marissa has put together. She's been an absolute star working through how users are actually going to work with this education content that is completely new for us. So as you can see at the top, it'll have the video option, and at the bottom, it'll be the blog. And I've got some info here about what that'll look like. So on the right here, this is a visual of what the blog could look like, and Mercedes worked on all of these images, and they're great. For the videos, I think it's really, really cool. I'm excited about that. So I'm not gonna have you watch the whole thing, but we'll just watch a little bit of the intro and show you what we've put together and what it's gonna look like for the participants when they're going through it. I hope you'll be able to hear the sound. Hi there, I'm Lainey, and I'm a genetic counselor for the University of Pennsylvania's ILS Center and FTD Center. In this video series, I'll be talking you through the genetics of ILS, also called motor neuron disease, and addressing the questions that I get asked the most as a genetic counselor. Specifically, I'm going to walk you through the genetics of ILS, genetic testing, and whether it's right for you, and what you can expect if you go down the genetic testing route. So these are available for anybody to see. I'll show you one more animation just because I think it's really cool. But basically, if you guys have feedback on these, we'd love to see what you think. We are working hard to learn about what those factors actually are, such as environmental exposures, trauma to the body, lifestyle factors, and small genetic risk factors. There's also research underway to better understand what might protect someone from developing ILS. Right, so that's a sneak peek of the educational content, but if anyone is more interested in it, like what the actual videos look like, or any, just want to have a look at it all put together, Mercedes and I can show you the links. But yeah, so I want to say thank you to Mercedes, thank you to Marissa. They've been getting huge shoutouts during this All Hands, and they absolutely deserve it because they've done huge work to putting this together, and I couldn't be more pleased. And also Amy for actually writing all the blog content. They've all been great. And any questions about Light the Way for me, we'll hand over to Decibel. Any chance we could break down the videos into chapters, find it useful for our videos to skip the parts I'm interested in? Yeah, I think that's a great idea to put in like, what are they called? Bookmarks? They're not bookmarks, but the benches with the information, that would be a good addition to it. Right. Jamie, you're on Decibel? Yeah, I'm on Decibel today as Liam is bubbling on his way back home, I think. So are you holding now? Are you controlling it? Cool. Yeah, hold on the forward. Perfect. So this is Decibel. And I guess a quick recap for those that don't know, it's an awareness and engagement campaign for patients and caregivers of those with hearing loss and genetic hearing loss. And I guess a quick summary of this study is that it will be broken down into two phases. The first phase will be a landing page. And this is being aimed to be developed by the 26th of May. The second phase will be a go live on the full portal. And this is aiming to be ready by the 21st of July. However, this makes, if we're basically unsure if there's a IRB need for this study, because of its uniqueness, and because it's not technically qualified as research, we're kind of in discussion with Decibel at the moment as to whether this needs full IRB approval and will kind of impact the timelines as necessary. But yeah, we're currently assessing if we can move forward with the project without an IRB approval. And we hopefully expect to hear back from them towards the end of next week. So that should give us some sort of clarification on that. While we wait for that, we're kind of proactively developing a protocol anyway, in case we do need to go down the IRB route, and that's kind of being ready, hopefully ready by Tuesday next week. And so Hayley, if you can just move to the next slide, please. Cool. So as you can see, the timelines are pretty much as they were before. And we are on track with the only contentious issue is if we need IRB approval, which might push back the protocol development timelines, and then ultimately the go live timeline by a few weeks. However, if not, then it should be back to a standard time yielded ready by the 21st of July. Does anyone have any questions on Decibel? I guess we can move on. I think Julie on it. Hi, everyone. So this is just a quick overview of where we are on the Lilly study. So for those of you who don't know, this study is involving patients with frontotemporal dementia, which is a form of dementia similar to ",
    "third": "waiting room and while the marketing team is focusing on the one-to-many, one of the things I'm working on is shaping that one-to-one approach for our high value patients, for lack of a better phrase. So as Chris mentioned last week, we should hope to have an upcoming Lark2 Alzheimer's studies with Biogen and over the last few weeks or so in anticipation of this I reached out to our Lark2 patients from the ESCAPE Bio study we ran last year to get a sense of engagement and to add some context because I know there's quite a few new joiners this year. Last year we also ran a study in Lark2 Alzheimer's with a company called ESCAPE Bio. We found around 40 people with Lark2 so you know I want to keep them warm in anticipation of the study. So I reached out to around the 40-ish patients who had Lark2 and off and to the call made to sort of get and the idea was that like a short 15-minute conversation with them to like understand how they're doing and what support they think they could need, keep them engage and be empathetic and sort of make them feel like Santa is someone or a brand they can trust and also to sort of see if they had any feedback for us and any improvements we could make to future studies. And in terms of results, engagement was pretty good so we had around 50% of those patients replied and I'm not solving like regular-ish contact with them and as the year goes on and we installed the recruitment period of this study so I'll sort of work with Lauren and Kurt to push a bit harder to try to re-engage those who haven't replied. But yeah I'm no I'm no Marcus of it but like a pretty decent response rate having not been too too pushy at all. Next slide please. And in terms of what went well, patients were like really really engaged and you know they were really keen to take part in future studies so and it felt like we had we sort of had a good community of engaged sort of patients or participants. Most of the calls would like last well over like the planned 15 minutes as patients were like really keen to tell me that how they were coping and how their conditions progressing and I did leave like most of the calls being feeling quite confident in this like one-to-one be like virtual waiting approach does have a lot of potential to keep patients engaged when and if we need to use it. In terms of what didn't go so well, the calls for me felt quite strange in that I didn't really have a lot to say like they lacked a bit of structure in that all I was kind of really saying was like we might have a study coming up are you up for it? And I think this lack of purpose is totally normal like the first time around as we begin to feel out this like one-to-one approach but something I slash we need to map out in future depth as sort of we ramp up the number of studies we're doing. Next I'm not the biggest expert in Parkinson's so go back I'm no expert in Parkinson's so for me the call felt a bit difficult at a time. I didn't pretend to be an expert in in Parkinson's but for me it felt a bit clear that they sort of wanted to speak to somebody who knew their stuff a bit more and could empathize with their conditions and I also wanted to use these conversations to get a sense of like how we could sort of shape this service as we got bigger but they didn't they sort of struggled to answer the question of like what feedback or what things what things they could do to like improve the service that we're giving so and I haven't really had like much gotten much back from them in sort of like the couple of months of communication I've been I've been talking to talking to them with and in terms of things to do next I think the main thing that we need to do is like map out in more detail like the why of each call and the various touch points in like the coming weeks months as all these studies come online and I'll sort of be working with like marketing to build out on almost like an experimentation board of tests we can do to see what drives engagement. Sorry I spoke really quickly because I was conscious of time but yeah that's it for me if you have any questions happy to answer them. Take that as a no. Rochelle over to you. Cool thanks both teams for great updates that was fab but before we go has anyone got any announcements or shout outs they'd like to share this week big now or forever hold your peace? I'd like to say thank you to Grace for jumping in on this PPI stuff she's been here like two weeks and it's already taken us over and it's doing a great job so thank you very much tonight. And Helen I can see you've got your hand raised there feel free. Yeah second that shout out to Grace she's just jumped in there and ran with things and I've been super impressed with how quickly she's on boarding so thank you so much for picking things up especially with Lyndy being out a bit so you are you know just getting in there and getting stuck in so it's really appreciated and also huge shout out to Amy you have produced some fantastic content over the last couple of weeks and also the way that you've managed some of our clients expectations and worked with them to produce some really brilliant content and pieces particularly for the landing page and the iterations and also Mercedes for your help on that so thanks so much guys. Great thanks for that anyone else before we head out? I think Axelle already mentioned but shout out to Mercedes and Marisa for all your help in making the reports 10 times better than the original version and to Heath of course for reviewing all of the genetics the terms and so on and Adam as well contributed to that so it's really been a team effort I think as Axelle highlighted in her slides so much appreciated. And don't forget Lee thank you because he was like in all of the meeting trying to like help us balance everything we need. Yeah I'm sure for the record there are probably like a lot of other people we should acknowledge in the process of doing this report you know including Hannah and others but yeah basically shout out to everybody who contributed. Nice thanks everyone that's a great way to end our All Hands this week. Cool so I wish you all a great rest of the week and we'll catch you next week see you guys. Bye everybody. Bye everyone.",
